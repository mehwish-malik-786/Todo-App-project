# Todo App Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-First Fidelity
Every feature must originate from a human-authored, Markdown-based specification. Implementation is exclusively generated by Claude Code from these specs—no manual code edits allowed.

### Progressive Intelligence
Each phase must build upon the previous one, adding architectural sophistication while preserving behavioral correctness. AI capabilities emerge only after foundational layers are spec-complete.

### Cloud-Native by Design
From Phase IV onward, all components must adhere to 12-factor app principles, be container-ready, and deployable on Kubernetes with full observability.

### User-Centric Autonomy
The AI agent must act on behalf of the user with clear intent parsing, state awareness, and safe execution—never hallucinating or bypassing validation.

### Reproducible Excellence
Every commit must be traceable to a spec change. The system must be rebuildable from specs alone, with zero "magic" or undocumented assumptions.

### Zero Manual Code Constraint
No manual code editing is allowed. All code must be generated via Claude Code from specifications. Violation results in automatic disqualification.

## Key Standards

### Specification Format
- All specs in `/specs/` using Spec-Kit Plus conventions
- Each spec includes: user stories, acceptance criteria, error cases
- Cross-referenced via `@specs/path/to/file.md`

### Code Generation Protocol
- All code generated via Claude Code using context from `CLAUDE.md` and relevant specs
- No post-generation manual edits; if output is incorrect, refine the spec

### Tech Stack Compliance
- Phase I: Pure Python 3.13+, in-memory, no external deps
- Phase II: Next.js (App Router), FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless Postgres
- Phase III+: OpenAI Agents SDK + Official MCP SDK for tool calling
- Phase IV–V: Docker, Helm, Minikube → DOKS, with Dapr & Kafka for events

### Security & Isolation
- Phase II+: JWT-based auth with user data isolation enforced at DB and API layers
- Secrets managed via environment variables; never hardcoded

### Artifact Completeness
- Every phase includes:
  ✅ `Constitution.md`
  ✅ Versioned specs in `/specs/`
  ✅ `CLAUDE.md` with clear generation instructions
  ✅ Working demo (local or deployed)
  ✅ 90-second video showing all core features

## Constraints

- Zero Manual Code: Violation = automatic disqualification
- Spec Completeness: Every user-facing behavior must be spec'd before generation
- Phase Gatekeeping: Cannot advance to Phase N+1 until Phase N is fully spec'd, implemented, and demonstrated
- Monorepo Structure: Frontend/backend in single repo with layered `CLAUDE.md` context
- Public Visibility: All code and specs must be in a public GitHub repo

## Success Criteria

A phase is successful only when all of the following are true:

✅ All required features (Basic → Advanced) are implemented exactly as specified
✅ App runs end-to-end with no runtime errors under normal usage
✅ Specifications are clear, testable, and complete (no gaps in acceptance criteria)
✅ Claude Code logs (`CLAUDE.md`) document prompt iterations and spec refinements
✅ Demo video (≤90 sec) shows *real usage*—not just code or static UI
✅ Architecture aligns with the declared stack for that phase
✅ For Phases III–V: AI agent correctly interprets and executes natural language todo commands (e.g., "Mark 'Buy milk' as done")

## Governance

This constitution serves as the governing document for the Todo App project. All development activities must align with the principles and standards outlined above. Amendments to this constitution require explicit documentation of the changes, their rationale, and their impact on existing specifications and implementations.

**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-02 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-02

> **Final Vision**: This Todo app is not just a task manager—it is a living blueprint for **AI-native, spec-governed software development**. By completing all five phases, you prove that the future engineer is an architect of intelligence, not a coder of syntax.
