# Update Todo App Constitution

## Prompt Text

```
/sp.constitution **Project**: The Evolution of Todo – From Spec-Driven Console App to Cloud-Native AI Agent  
**Mission**: To demonstrate the future of software development by evolving a Todo application through five architectural phases—strictly using **Spec-Driven Development**, **Claude Code**, and **Reusable Intelligence**—without manual coding.

---

### **Core Principles**

1. **Spec-First Fidelity**  
   Every feature must originate from a human-authored, Markdown-based specification. Implementation is *exclusively* generated by Claude Code from these specs—**no manual code edits allowed**.

2. **Progressive Intelligence**  
   Each phase must build upon the previous one, adding architectural sophistication while preserving behavioral correctness. AI capabilities emerge only after foundational layers are spec-complete.

3. **Cloud-Native by Design**  
   From Phase IV onward, all components must adhere to 12-factor app principles, be container-ready, and deployable on Kubernetes with full observability.

4. **User-Centric Autonomy**  
   The AI agent must act *on behalf of the user* with clear intent parsing, state awareness, and safe execution—never hallucinating or bypassing validation.

5. **Reproducible Excellence**  
   Every commit must be traceable to a spec change. The system must be rebuildable from specs alone, with zero "magic" or undocumented assumptions.

---

### **Key Standards**

- **Specification Format**:  
  - All specs in `/specs/` using Spec-Kit Plus conventions  
  - Each spec includes: user stories, acceptance criteria, error cases  
  - Cross-referenced via `@specs/path/to/file.md`

- **Code Generation Protocol**:  
  - All code generated via Claude Code using context from `CLAUDE.md` and relevant specs  
  - No post-generation manual edits; if output is incorrect, refine the spec

- **Tech Stack Compliance**:  
  - Phase I: Pure Python 3.13+, in-memory, no external deps  
  - Phase II: Next.js (App Router), FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless Postgres  
  - Phase III+: OpenAI Agents SDK + Official MCP SDK for tool calling  
  - Phase IV–V: Docker, Helm, Minikube → DOKS, with Dapr & Kafka for events

- **Security & Isolation**:  
  - Phase II+: JWT-based auth with user data isolation enforced at DB and API layers  
  - Secrets managed via environment variables; never hardcoded

- **Artifact Completeness**:  
  - Every phase includes:  
    ✅ `Constitution.md`  
    ✅ Versioned specs in `/specs/`  
    ✅ `CLAUDE.md` with clear generation instructions  
    ✅ Working demo (local or deployed)  
    ✅ 90-second video showing all core features

---

### **Constraints**

- **Zero Manual Code**: Violation = automatic disqualification  
- **Spec Completeness**: Every user-facing behavior must be spec'd before generation  
- **Phase Gatekeeping**: Cannot advance to Phase N+1 until Phase N is fully spec’d, implemented, and demonstrated  
- **Monorepo Structure**: Frontend/backend in single repo with layered `CLAUDE.md` context  
- **Public Visibility**: All code and specs must be in a public GitHub repo

---

### **Success Criteria**

A phase is **successful** only when all of the following are true:

✅ All required features (Basic → Advanced) are implemented **exactly as specified**  
✅ App runs end-to-end with no runtime errors under normal usage  
✅ Specifications are clear, testable, and complete (no gaps in acceptance criteria)  
✅ Claude Code logs (`CLAUDE.md`) document prompt iterations and spec refinements  
✅ Demo video (≤90 sec) shows *real usage*—not just code or static UI  
✅ Architecture aligns with the declared stack for that phase  
✅ For Phases III–V: AI agent correctly interprets and executes natural language todo commands (e.g., “Mark ‘Buy milk’ as done”)  

---

> **Final Vision**: This Todo app is not just a task manager—it is a living blueprint for **AI-native, spec-governed software development**. By completing all five phases, you prove that the future engineer is an architect of intelligence, not a coder of syntax.

---

This `sp.constitution` sets a high bar for rigor, aligns with Panaversity's mission, and gives Claude Code clear guardrails to generate production-grade, evolvable systems. Use it as the root governing document for your entire repository. 🚀

## Response Text

Updated the constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the provided principles and project specifications. The new constitution includes:

- Core principles: Spec-First Fidelity, Progressive Intelligence, Cloud-Native by Design, User-Centric Autonomy, Reproducible Excellence, and Zero Manual Code Constraint
- Key Standards for specification format, code generation protocol, tech stack compliance, security & isolation, and artifact completeness
- Constraints including zero manual code, spec completeness, phase gatekeeping, monorepo structure, and public visibility
- Success criteria for each phase
- Governance section with version information

The constitution now serves as the governing document for the Todo App project, establishing clear guidelines for spec-driven development using AI assistance.

## Outcome

The constitution has been successfully updated to reflect the project's mission of evolving a Todo application through five architectural phases using Spec-Driven Development and AI assistance without manual coding. The new constitution provides clear principles and standards to guide the development process.

## Evaluation

The updated constitution aligns with the project's goals and provides clear, testable principles for the development team to follow. All placeholder tokens have been replaced with concrete values based on the user's input, and the document follows the required format and structure.
